# diptest

## R CRAN package `diptest`: Hartigan's diptest for unimodality (including p-values)

Although this package `diptest` has been created a long time ago, with a
first CRAN publication in 2003, see the official page of
[CRAN package diptest](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=diptest), the
package *development* sources and history have only been made available on
Nov.30, 2020.

As with my R package [sfsmisc](https://github.com/mmaechler/sfsmisc), I was
able to keep most of the editing and development _history_ of this package,
using my [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) backup files (`*.~`)
together with some RCS (`*,v`) histories, using my `G2RCSn` shell script,
and most importantly a `ruby` script to create a git repos including
history, see here, for how it worked with `sfsmisc`:
