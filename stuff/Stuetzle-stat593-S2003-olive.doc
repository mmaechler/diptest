---- MM : I have constructed  ./olive.tab  which you can read into R with

olives <-
   read.table("/u/maechler/R/Pkgs/diptest/stuff/Stuetzle-stat593-S2003-olive.tab",
              header=TRUE)

## together with code in ./jeremy-unimodality.R :
all.equal(unname(olives.CF[,-2]), unname(olives[,-2])) ## TRUE
## but clearly, also the last three *Variable* names differ...  [aargh]
