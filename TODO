o  The vignette inst/doc/diptest-issues.Rnw
    (for 0.75-1, on CRAN, since 2011-08-10) is TERRIBLY outdated.
   Notably it does not even mention the new  dip.test()  function
	

o  Consider an analogue qnormDiptab  which is constructed using
   rnorm(.) instead of runif(.) simulations

   <--> This idea is old; Werner Stuetzle's student,
   	Jeremy Tantrum, did things in this direction in 2003;
	see, stuff/jeremy-unimodality.R

would be nice:

o  Visualize the l.c.m. and g.c.m. and the modal interval !
   g.c.m = greatest convex minorant =: G(x)
   l.c.m = least   concave majorant =: H(x)
